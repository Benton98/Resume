My passion for the liberal arts and research habits have endowed me with a unique skill set and perspective. Being a consumer and scholar of music as well as having an understanding of music production, signal processing, sound physics and programming has enabled me to understand the needs of the consumers in the music technology industry 
and how we can meet them. This enables me to transform the innovations occurring in the field of signal processing into useful products for established music and media consumers.


I'm currently involved in research that explores the utility of interfacing acoustic sources of sound with virtual instruments using spectral modeling synthesis (SMS). I used these SMS techniques to model and combine natural, timbral dynamics of an electric guitar with a synthesizer. This has the effect of making the synthesizer sound more like an acoustic instrument.

I'm currently interested in expanding my knowledge of machine learning particularly in the application of convolutional neural networks to sound source separation. Mixing and recording ambisonics has also made me very curious about the technology behind rendering and compressing ambisonic soundscapes. Particularly, I'd love to learn how CNN source separation could be used to reduce spectral distortion and improve sound localization in soundscapes.
