## Forward
My passion for the liberal arts and research habits have endowed me with a unique skill set and perspective. Being a consumer and scholar of music as well as a signal processing engineer, I have obtained an understanding of both the state of the art of signal processing as well as an insight into the needs of the consumers in the music technology industry. This enables me to take transform the innovations ocurring in the field of signal processing into useful products for established music and media consumers.
