## Forward
My passion for the liberal arts and research habits have endowed me with a unique skill set and perspective. Being a consumer and scholar of music as well as a signal processing engineer, I have obtained an understanding of both the state of the art of signal processing as well as an insight into the needs of the consumers in the music technology industry. This enables me to take transform the innovations ocurring in the field of signal processing into useful products for established music and media consumers.
  I have a keen interest in the utility of convolutional neural networks to sound source separation. I'm curious how CNN source separation could be used to reduce spectral distorition and improve sound localization in soundscapes.
   My research has also led me to explore the world spectral modeling sythesis and General Adversarial Network Synthesizers. More specifically using these techniques to model and combine nuances of multiple timbres for the post production, soudn design and music production.

## Education
### B.S. Computer Science and Music Technology | University of North Carolina Asheville
##### September 2017 - Present
Focused my studies on Digital Audio Signal Processing & Recording
### Classes
- Audio Engineering Technology I-IV
- Recording Practicum I-IV
- Statistical Programming
- Object Oriented Programming
- Electronics
- Data Structures
- Physics of Sound
### MOOCs
#### Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications
 .* This course was developed by Xavier Serra of Universitat Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona and Julius O. Smith III of Stanford University. This course details a method of modeling and synthesizing audio known as Spectral Modeling Synthesis (SMS) involving extracting sinusoidal model from a STFT of a sound and creating a stochastic model of the residual noise of the spectrum.
#### Machine Learning 
.* This course is taught by the revolutionary AI researcher and co-founder of google brain, Andrew Ng. This course details the tools, concepts and methodology surrounding machine learning, datamining and statistical pattern recognition.
