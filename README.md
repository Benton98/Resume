## Forward
My passion for the liberal arts and research habits have endowed me with a unique skill set and perspective. Being a consumer and scholar of music as well as a signal processing engineer, I have an insight into both state of the art technology and the needs of consumers of music technology. As a lifelong learner, I love connecting with others who share my passion for innovative applications of mathematics to make social change happen. I aspire to be a catalyst for innovation.
