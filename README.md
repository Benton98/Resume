# Cover Letter
My passion for the liberal arts and research habits have endowed me with a unique skill set and perspective. Being a consumer and scholar of music as well as a signal processing engineer, I have obtained an understanding of both the state of the art of signal processing as well as an insight into the needs of the consumers in the music technology industry. This enables me to take transform the innovations ocurring in the field of signal processing into useful products for established music and media consumers.
  I have a keen interest in the utility of convolutional neural networks to sound source separation. I'm curious how CNN source separation could be used to reduce spectral distorition and improve sound localization in soundscapes.
   My research has also led me to explore the world spectral modeling sythesis and General Adversarial Network Synthesizers. More specifically using these techniques to model and combine nuances of multiple timbres for the post production, soudn design and music production.
